This is a parallel programming language. Basis for this is Java and the language itself resembles Python.

Today’s software systems are extremely demanding compared to the likes of the
early 20th century and to keep up, programming languages have been updated and
modified accordingly. They have become accustomed to today’s technology by becoming
faster, progressive and more efficient. Especially with parallel programming in which, for
example, MPI (Message Passing Interface) has been infused to allow the execution of
code over several processors. Nevertheless, the one missing ingredient user and overall
system clarity is simplicity.

You can see how the language looks compared to Java in the uploaded image file.

Did it prove to be much faster? Not really.
